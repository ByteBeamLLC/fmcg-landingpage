## Executive Summary

This PRD addresses critical SEO issues identified on bytebeam.co that are limiting organic search visibility and indexation. The primary concerns are:

1. **Crawl/Render Accessibility Risk** — Site content is not extractable by crawlers (likely due to client-side rendering)
2. **Limited Index Footprint** — Only homepage and /about page are discoverable in search results
3. **Brand/Domain Ambiguity** — Confusion with bytebeam.io (IoT/connected vehicles)

**Goal:** Ensure search engines can discover, crawl, render, and index all marketing pages to drive non-branded organic traffic.

---

## Problem Statement

When crawlers attempt to fetch and parse the site's HTML, pages return no readable content. This is a material SEO risk because:
- Search engines may not reliably see content
- Indexation is delayed or incomplete
- Non-branded organic traffic cannot be captured

**Current State:**
- Search results surface only homepage and /about page
- Brand queries may be diluted by bytebeam.io presence
- Messaging around "No-Code AI Document Automation" is not reaching target audiences through organic search

## Success Metrics

| Metric | Current | Target | Timeline |
|--------|---------|--------|----------|
| Indexed pages in GSC | ~2 | 15+ | 30 days |
| HTML content visible to crawlers | No | Yes | 7 days |
| Core Web Vitals (LCP) | Unknown | < 2.5s | 14 days |
| Non-branded organic sessions | Baseline TBD | +50% | 90 days |
| Demo CTA conversions from organic | Baseline TBD | +25% | 90 days |

## Work Streams

### 🔴 P0: Critical — Technical SEO (Crawlability)

Ensure bots can reliably see content. This is the highest priority blocker.

#### Tasks

- [ ] **Audit current rendering strategy**
  - [ ] Determine if site is React SPA, Next.js, or other framework
  - [ ] Document current SSR/CSR configuration
  - [ ] Test with `curl` or `wget` to verify HTML content in response

- [ ] **Implement Server-Side Rendering (SSR) or Static Generation**
  - [ ] Enable SSR/SSG for all marketing pages (homepage, about, solutions, industries)
  - [ ] Ensure primary H1, headline copy, and internal links are in initial HTML
  - [ ] Verify meta tags (title, description, OG tags) render server-side

- [ ] **Validate bot access**
  - [ ] Review `robots.txt` — ensure no inadvertent blocks
  - [ ] Check meta robots tags on all pages (no `noindex` on public pages)
  - [ ] Review WAF/CDN rules (Vercel, Cloudflare) for bot restrictions
  - [ ] Test with Google's Mobile-Friendly Test and Rich Results Test

- [ ] **Fix URL canonicalization**
  - [ ] Ensure consistent www vs non-www
  - [ ] Enforce consistent trailing slash behavior
  - [ ] Add canonical tags to all pages
  - [ ] Verify redirects (301, not 302) for URL variants

**Acceptance Criteria:**
```
✅ Basic fetch of homepage URL returns HTML containing headline and body copy
✅ Google Search Console "URL Inspection" shows "Page is indexed"
✅ GSC Live Test renders page correctly with all content visible
```
