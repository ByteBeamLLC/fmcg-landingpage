![SFDA drug registration process flowchart showing 8 steps from application to approval](/images/blog/sfda-drug-registration-process-flowchart.jpg)
*SFDA drug registration follows an 8-step process from submission to market authorization*

Saudi Arabia's pharmaceutical market is valued at approximately USD 10.86 billion in 2025, with projected growth at a CAGR of 6.18% through 2032.[^1] For pharmaceutical companies seeking market access, SFDA drug registration is the critical gateway—and understanding the process can mean the difference between timely market entry and costly delays.

This comprehensive guide covers the complete SFDA registration process, from initial application through post-approval requirements, helping regulatory affairs professionals navigate Saudi Arabia's pharmaceutical approval system efficiently.

## Understanding the SFDA

### Role and Authority

The Saudi Food and Drug Authority (SFDA) is the regulatory body responsible for ensuring the safety, efficacy, and quality of pharmaceutical products in Saudi Arabia. Established by Royal Decree No. (M/6) dated 25/1/1428 H (13/02/2007), the SFDA oversees the manufacture, import, export, distribution, promotion, and advertising of medicinal products.[^2]

**Key milestones:**
- **2021:** SFDA became a full regulatory member of the International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) and achieved WHO Maturity Level 4, placing it among the world's leading regulatory authorities[^3]
- **PIC/S Membership:** SFDA became the first Arab country admitted to the Pharmaceutical Inspection Co-operation Scheme (PIC/S), which harmonizes GMP inspection standards across 54 regulatory authorities worldwide[^4]

### Registration Categories

The SFDA processes registrations for four main categories of medicinal products:[^5]

| Category | Description | Documentation Requirements |
|----------|-------------|---------------------------|
| **New Drug** | Novel chemical entities, including biosimilars | Full 5-module CTD dossier |
| **New Chemical Entity** | First-in-class compounds | Complete clinical and non-clinical data |
| **Generic Drugs** | Bioequivalent versions of approved drugs | Abbreviated dossier with BE studies |
| **Biological Drugs** | Biopharmaceuticals and biosimilars | Full quality, non-clinical, and clinical modules |

## Pre-Submission Requirements

Before submitting a drug registration application, pharmaceutical companies must fulfill several prerequisites.

### Manufacturing Site Requirements

All manufacturers—domestic and international—must comply with SFDA's GMP Guidelines, which are based on WHO and PIC/S standards.[^4]

**GMP inspection process:**
- SFDA incorporates manufacturer registration within the drug application review
- The SFDA inspection team conducts on-site visits lasting 3-5 days
- Risk-based assessment determines whether a GMP visit is required
- GMP inspection can be waived if the facility is approved by GCC Drug Registration[^4]

**Common GMP deficiencies (2018-2021 SFDA data):**[^4]
1. Production processes
2. Premises and equipment
3. Quality control validation
4. Materials management
5. Quality management
6. Personnel

Between 2018 and 2021, SFDA performed 344 GMP inspections both within and outside Saudi Arabia.[^4]

### Documentation Standards

The SFDA requires applications in the electronic Common Technical Document (eCTD) format, aligning with ICH standards.[^6]

**CTD Module Structure:**

| Module | Content | Requirements |
|--------|---------|--------------|
| **Module 1** | Administrative Information | Application forms, cover letters, CPP, authorization letters, patent declaration |
| **Module 2** | Summaries | Quality, non-clinical, and clinical overviews |
| **Module 3** | Quality (CMC) | Drug substance and drug product specifications, stability data |
| **Module 4** | Non-Clinical | Pharmacology and toxicology studies |
| **Module 5** | Clinical | Clinical study reports, efficacy and safety data |

**2024 Module 1 Updates:**[^7]
- Declaration letter on patent status of the product now required
- Marketing Authorization Holder section must include an "Authorization Letter" on finished product manufacturer letterhead

### Regulatory Agent Requirements

Foreign pharmaceutical companies must appoint a Saudi Authorized Representative (SAR) for regulatory submissions.[^3]

**Local agent requirements:**
- Must hold an authorized representative license (renewable annually at SAR 2,600/year)[^8]
- Acts as official liaison with SFDA
- Responsible for regulatory submissions, safety monitoring, and communication
- Required for all foreign medicinal product manufacturers

**Options for market entry:**
1. **Appoint a local agent:** Most common approach for international companies
2. **Establish a local entity:** Through Ministry of Investment (MISA) as a foreign investment firm—feasible for multinationals with established Saudi market presence[^3]

## Step-by-Step Registration Process

![Screenshot of SFDA eSDR portal login page for drug registration](/images/blog/sfda-esdr-portal-screenshot.jpg)
*The eSDR portal is the main submission system for SFDA drug registration*

### Step 1: Registry Enrollment

Before submitting applications, companies must register with the Drug Establishments National Registry (DENR) to obtain login credentials for SFDA's electronic systems.[^5]

**Electronic systems used:**
- **eSDR (Saudi Drug Registration):** Main portal for application submission
- **GHAD System:** Unified electronic system for tracking and monitoring[^9]

### Step 2: Pre-Submission Consultation (Optional)

SFDA allows companies to request pre-submission meetings and pre-pricing assessments.

**Pre-pricing service:**[^10]
- Available before submitting registration application
- Fee: SAR 20,000
- Helps companies understand pricing expectations before committing to full registration

### Step 3: Application Submission

Submit the complete Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) through the eSDR system.[^5]

**Submission requirements:**
- Completed application forms
- eCTD files on three CDs labeled per SFDA guidelines
- Hard copies of original documents (cover letter, Certificate of Pharmaceutical Product, application form)
- Human drugs require eCTD format; veterinary drugs accept vNEES or CTD[^3]

### Step 4: Administrative Review (Validation)

SFDA conducts initial completeness and technical verification.[^5]

**What's checked:**
- Application completeness
- Document formatting compliance
- Fee payment verification
- Technical requirements met

**Timeline:** Validation typically completed within 30 days

### Step 5: Scientific Assessment

The comprehensive evaluation phase includes multiple review tracks:[^3]

**Review components:**
