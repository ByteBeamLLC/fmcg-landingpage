*Example of a compliant UAE food label with Arabic text and nutritional table*

Non-compliance with UAE food labeling requirements can result in fines ranging from AED 10,000 to AED 2,000,000, shipment rejections at ports, and even imprisonment for serious violations.[^1] For food manufacturers, importers, and distributors operating in the UAE, understanding these regulations is not optional—it's essential for market access.

This comprehensive guide covers everything you need to know about UAE food labeling compliance in 2026, including the regulatory bodies involved, mandatory label elements, industry-specific requirements, and a step-by-step compliance checklist.

## Understanding UAE Food Regulatory Bodies

![Diagram showing UAE food regulatory bodies: ESMA, Dubai Municipality, and ADAFSA](/images/blog/uae-food-regulatory-bodies-diagram.jpg)
*UAE food labeling is governed by three main regulatory authorities*

Three primary authorities govern food labeling in the UAE. Each has specific jurisdiction and requirements that food businesses must navigate.

### ESMA (Emirates Authority for Standardization and Metrology)

The Emirates Authority for Standardization and Metrology, now operating under the Ministry of Industry and Advanced Technology (MoIAT), is responsible for setting national food labeling standards.[^2]

**Key responsibilities include:**
- Developing and enforcing UAE food labeling standards
- Publishing technical regulations for food products
- Managing the Emirates Conformity Assessment Scheme (ECAS)
- Overseeing Halal certification through the UAE Halal National Mark

The primary standard governing food labeling is **UAE.S 9:2017 "Labelling of Prepackaged Food Stuffs"**, which replaced the earlier GSO 9:2013 standard. This was further updated by **UAE.S 9:2019**, made mandatory through Cabinet Resolution No. (4) of 2020.[^3]

**2026 Updates - NutriMark Now Active:**
Abu Dhabi's **NutriMark scheme** became effective June 1, 2025, and is now in full enforcement. This front-of-pack labeling system grades products from A to E based on energy, saturated fat, sugars, sodium, protein, and fiber content. Currently applicable to packaged and non-packaged breads, pastries, beverages, fats, oils, and fat emulsions—with potential expansion to additional categories in 2026.[^4]

### Dubai Municipality

Dubai Municipality manages food product registration through the **Montaji Portal** (formerly known as FIRS - Food Import and Re-export System). All food products sold in Dubai must be registered before entering the market.[^5]

**Key functions:**
- Product registration and approval via Montaji portal
- Label assessment and approval
- Laboratory testing through Dubai Central Laboratory (DCL)
- Integration with customs for import clearance

**Registration fees:**[^6]
- Submission fee: AED 10 per product
- Certificate printing fee: AED 220 (optional)
- Processing timeline: 10-30 days

### Abu Dhabi Agriculture and Food Safety Authority (ADAFSA)

ADAFSA is the local authority responsible for food safety in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi. In June 2022, ADAFSA launched the **Food Import and Export Management Information System (FIEMIS)** to streamline food import and export procedures.[^7]

**FIEMIS capabilities:**
- Single window for importers and exporters
- Pre-arrival clearance for imported food shipments
- Risk-based inspection system
- Unified control platform for food import/export activities

## Mandatory Label Requirements

![Infographic showing 12 mandatory elements on UAE food labels](/images/blog/uae-mandatory-label-elements-infographic.jpg)
*12 mandatory elements required on all UAE food product labels*

All pre-packaged food products sold in the UAE must include specific information on their labels. The following requirements are mandated under UAE.S 9:2017 and UAE.S GSO 2233:2021.[^8]

### Required Information on All Food Labels

| Element | Requirement | Source |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| Product Name | Clear, truthful product identification | UAE.S 9:2017 |
| Ingredients List | Listed in descending order by weight | UAE.S 9:2017 |
| Net Quantity | Weight or volume in metric units | UAE.S 9:2017 |
| Country of Origin | Specific country (e.g., "Made in USA") | UAE.S 9:2017 |
| Manufacturer Details | Company name, address, contact details | UAE.S 9:2017 |
| Local Importer | UAE-based distributor name and address | UAE.S 9:2017 |
| Production Date | Clearly stated on packaging | UAE.S 9:2017 |
| Expiry Date | Format depends on shelf life | UAE.S 9:2017 |

| Allergen Declarations | Highlighted for major allergens | UAE.S 9:2017 |
| Batch/Lot Number | Required for traceability and recalls | UAE.S 9:2017 |

### Arabic Language Requirements

Arabic labeling is mandatory for all food products sold in the UAE. Labels may be in Arabic only or bilingual (Arabic and English), but Arabic must always be present.[^9]

**Key language requirements:**
- Arabic text must not be smaller than English text
- Arabic stickers are accepted but must be approved by UAE authorities prior to use
- Stickering must be completed before export—not upon entry to UAE
- All mandatory information must appear in Arabic, including ingredients and nutritional data

**Font specifications:**
- Minimum text height of approximately 1.6mm for legibility[^4]
- Sans-serif fonts recommended for clarity
- Sufficient contrast between text and background required
- Arabic font must be readable at retail distance

### Date Format Requirements

The UAE follows specific date formatting rules based on product shelf life:[^10]

| Shelf Life | Required Format | Example |
|------------|-----------------|---------|
| 3 months or less | Day/Month/Year | 15/06/2025 |
| More than 3 months | Day/Month/Year OR Month/Year | 06/2025 |

**Important:** Production and expiry dates must be printed on the original manufactured label, not added later via stickers.

**Exemptions from expiry date requirement:**[^3]
- Fresh fruits and vegetables (including unpeeled or cut potatoes)
- Bakery products consumed within 24 hours of production

### Nutritional Information Table

Under UAE.S GSO 2233:2021, nutritional labeling is mandatory for pre-packaged foods intended for direct consumption.[^11]

**Required nutrients:**
- Energy (kcal)
- Protein (g)
- Total fat (g)
- Saturated fat (g)
- Total carbohydrates (g)
- Sugars (g)
- Sodium/Salt (g)
- Dietary fiber (g) - where applicable

**Nutrient Reference Values (NRVs) for labeling:**

| Nutrient | Daily Reference Value |
|----------|----------------------|
| Energy | 2000 kcal |
| Protein | 50 g |
| Total fat | 70 g |
| Saturates | 20 g |
| Cholesterol | 300 mg |
| Total carbohydrate | 260 g |
| Dietary fiber | 28 g |
| Sugar | 50 g |
| Salt | 6 g |

Nutritional values can be expressed per 100g/100ml or per serving size as determined by the national authority.[^11]

### Allergen Declarations

Food labels must clearly declare allergens to protect consumers with food sensitivities. Major allergens must be highlighted in both English and Arabic.[^12]

**Common allergens requiring declaration:**
- Nuts (including peanuts and tree nuts)
- Dairy/milk products
- Eggs
- Fish and shellfish
- Wheat/gluten
- Soy
- Sesame

**Labeling practices:**
- Allergens should be highlighted or emphasized in the ingredients list
- Precautionary statements like "may contain traces of..." recommended for cross-contamination risks
- Incomplete allergen declarations can result in product rejection or penalties

## Industry-Specific Requirements

Different food categories have additional labeling requirements beyond the general standards.

### Meat and Poultry Products

Meat products face stringent requirements due to Halal compliance and food safety concerns.[^13]

**Halal certification requirements:**
- Products claiming Halal status must have certification from UAE-approved certifiers
- Certificate of Islamic Slaughter must accompany all meat shipments
- Animals must be slaughtered by a practicing Muslim in the name of Allah

- Date of slaughter
- Date of processing
- Country of slaughter declaration
- Statement that product was slaughtered according to Islamic principles (recommended)

**Pork products:** Require clear labeling and must be sold in designated retail sections. Trading pork without proper licensing carries penalties up to AED 500,000.[^1]

### Dairy Products

Dairy products are regulated under Cabinet Resolution No. (29) of 2018 Regarding the UAE System for Control of Milk and Dairy Products.[^14]

**Applicable standards:**
- UAE.S/GSO CAC 206 - General Standard for the Use of Dairy Terms
- UAE.S/GSO 174 - Raw Milk

### Beverages and Energy Drinks

Energy drinks face specific regulations under UAE.S/GSO 1926:2009.[^15]

**Mandatory warning label for energy drinks:**
> "This product is not permitted for pregnant women, or women breast feeding, children under 16 years of age, persons susceptible to allergy by caffeine, or persons suffering from heart disease or athletes during sport practice."

**Additional requirements:**
- ECAS certificate required (valid for one year)
- Registration number must be visible on packaging in clear font
- Halal Certificate required as complementary documentation
- Sales prohibited in school canteens

### Packaged Foods with Additives

All food additives must be declared on the label:[^9]
- E-numbers are acceptable for additive identification
- Group names may be used alongside E-numbers
- Additives must be listed with their specific function (e.g., "preservative", "colorant")
- All additives must comply with UAE-approved lists

**GMO labeling:**
- Products containing GMO ingredients must state "Contains GMO ingredients"
- "GMO Free" claims require a certificate from a competent authority at the country of origin[^10]

**Organic claims:**
- Must have certification from an accredited body
- USDA Organic logo and certificate are accepted in the UAE[^10]

## Common Compliance Mistakes to Avoid

Based on industry experience and regulatory feedback, these are the most frequent labeling errors that lead to product rejection or penalties:[^16]

### 1. Incorrect or Incomplete Arabic Translation
The most common mistake is poor Arabic translation. This includes:
- Grammatical errors
- Missing mandatory information in Arabic
- Arabic text smaller than English text
- Using machine translation without professional review

### 2. Missing Local Importer Details
Every food product label must include the UAE-based importer or distributor's:
- Company name
- Physical address
- Contact information

This is required for traceability purposes and is frequently overlooked.

### 3. Date Format Errors
Using incorrect date formats (such as month/day/year American format instead of day/month/year) is a common rejection reason.

### 4. Absent or Invalid Certificates
Required certifications that are often missing:
- Halal certificate (for products claiming Halal status)
- GMO-free certificate (for GMO-free claims)
- Organic certification (for organic claims)
- Health certificates for specific product categories

### 5. Stickering After Import
Applying Arabic labels or stickers after products arrive in the UAE is prohibited. All stickering must be completed before export and approved by UAE authorities in advance.[^10]

### 6. Incomplete Allergen Information
Failure to highlight allergens or missing allergen declarations can result in:
- Product rejection at ports
- Mandatory recalls
- Consumer safety incidents
- Regulatory penalties

### 7. Expired Certificates or Documentation
Ensure all supporting documents (trade licenses, Halal certificates, lab reports) are current and valid at time of import.
