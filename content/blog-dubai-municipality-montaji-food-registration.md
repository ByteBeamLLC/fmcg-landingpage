![Dubai Municipality Montaji portal homepage for food product registration](/images/blog/montaji-portal-homepage-screenshot.jpg)
*The Montaji portal is Dubai Municipality's official platform for food product registration*

Importing or selling food products in Dubai without proper registration can result in shipment rejections at customs, product confiscation, and penalties. The Dubai Municipality's Montaji system is the gateway for all food product registrations—and understanding the process can mean the difference between smooth market entry and costly delays.

This step-by-step guide covers everything food importers, distributors, and manufacturers need to know about registering products through Dubai Municipality in 2026.

## What is the Montaji Portal?

### Overview

Montaji is Dubai Municipality's digital platform for registering and managing consumer products. The system ensures all food items meet UAE safety and labeling standards before reaching consumers.[^1]

The platform handles registration for:
- Food and beverage products
- Cosmetics and personal care items
- Health supplements
- Detergents and disinfectants
- Food contact materials (FCMs)

**Portal URL:** [montajiprd.dm.gov.ae](https://montajiprd.dm.gov.ae)

For food products specifically, registrations are processed through the **Food Import and Re-export System (FIRS)**, also known as the **ZAD Portal**, which integrates with Montaji.[^2]

### Who Needs to Register

All businesses selling food products in Dubai must register, including:[^1]

| Business Type | Registration Requirement |
|---------------|-------------------------|
| Importers | Required before importing |
| Local manufacturers | Required before market sale |
| Distributors | Required for distributed products |
| Re-exporters | Required for products passing through Dubai |
| Free zone companies | Required via mainland distributor |

**Important:** Consumer products imported for exhibitions, market tests, samples for marketing, or sole re-export purposes are exempt from registration requirements.[^3]

## Prerequisites for Registration

Before starting the registration process, ensure your business meets these requirements.

- **Authorized signatory** designated for regulatory submissions

**Free zone companies:** You must partner with a mainland distributor to handle the registration process. Free zone entities cannot register directly.[^4]

### Importer Code

Your company must have a valid importer code listed in your Montaji company profile. This code is essential for processing import consignments.[^3]

Gather the following documents before starting your application:[^1][^5]

**For all food products:**

- Clear images of product (front and back)
- Label artwork (Arabic and English versions)

### Step 4: Upload Required Documents

Log into Montaji and submit your Consumer Product Registration Request (CPRE).[^1]

**Document format requirements:**

**When testing is required:**
